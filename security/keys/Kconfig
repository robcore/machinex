config SDP
	bool "Enable SDP"
	help
	  This is a fake Kconfig description i am using
	  to test out a security feature found on better
	  samsung devices.

config TRUSTED_KEYS
	tristate "TRUSTED KEYS"
	depends on KEYS && TCG_TPM
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_HMAC
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	help
	  This option provides support for creating, sealing, and unsealing
	  keys in the kernel. Trusted keys are random number symmetric keys,
	  generated and RSA-sealed by the TPM. The TPM only unseals the keys,
	  if the boot PCRs and other criteria match.  Userspace will only ever
	  see encrypted blobs.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config ENCRYPTED_KEYS
	tristate "ENCRYPTED KEYS"
	depends on KEYS
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_HMAC
	select CRYPTO_AES
	select CRYPTO_CBC
	select CRYPTO_SHA256
	select CRYPTO_RNG
	help
	  This option provides support for create/encrypting/decrypting keys
	  in the kernel.  Encrypted keys are kernel generated random numbers,
	  which are encrypted/decrypted with a 'master' symmetric key. The
	  'master' key can be either a trusted-key or user-key type.
	  Userspace only ever sees/stores encrypted blobs.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config KEYS_DEBUG_PROC_KEYS
	bool "Enable the /proc/keys file by which keys may be viewed"
	depends on KEYS
	help
	  This option turns on support for the /proc/keys file - through which
	  can be listed all the keys on the system that are viewable by the
	  reading process.

	  The only keys included in the list are those that grant View
	  permission to the reading process whether or not it possesses them.
	  Note that LSM security checks are still performed, and may further
	  filter out keys that the current process is not authorised to view.

	  Only key attributes are listed here; key payloads are not included in
	  the resulting table.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.
