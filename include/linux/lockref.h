 * Locked reference counts.

 * These are different from just plain atomic refcounts in that they
 * are atomic with respect to the spinlock that goes with them.  In
 * particular, there can be implementations that don't actually get
 * the spinlock for the common decrement/increment operations, but they
 * still have to check that the operation is done semantically as if
 * the spinlock had been taken (using a cmpxchg operation that covers
 * both the lock and the count word, or using memory transactions, for
 * example).
