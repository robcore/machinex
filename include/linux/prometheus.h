 *
 * Autosleep and Hybird put back (eliminater74@gmail.com
 *
 * Further Enhanced by Rob Patershuk <robpatershuk@gmail.com>
 *
 *  v1.1 - make powersuspend not depend on a userspace initiator anymore,
 *         but use a hook in autosleep instead.
 *
 *  v1.2 - make kernel / userspace mode switchable
 *
 *  v1.3 - add a hook in display panel driver as alternative kernel trigger
 *
 *  v1.4 - add a hybrid-kernel mode, accepting both kernel hooks (first wins)
 *
 *  v1.5 - fix hybrid-kernel mode cannot be set through sysfs
 *
 *  v1.6 - remove autosleep and hybrid modes (autosleep not working on shamu)
 *
 *  v1.7 - do only run state change if change actually requests a new state
 *
 * v1.7.1 - Add autosleep and hybrid modes back
 *
 * v1.7.2 Cleanup
 *
 * v1.8.0 Changed "userspace" mode to disabled, and removed the ability to store
 *        to the syfs. Now The driver is autonomous, without any userspace
 *        interaction required/allowed. Also a little bit of sysfs
 *		  ordering cleanup.
 *
 * v1.8.1 Replaced deprecated singlethread workqueue with updated schedule_work.
 *
 * v1.9.1 Updated the depecrated method of declaring work but simply declaring
 *		  the two work structs.  Also actually INITialized the work on init, and
 *        flushed it on exit.
 *
 * v1.9.2 Remove unneccessary "MODE" variable as we only have one mechanism of
 *		  action remaining. Also removed the useless state sysfs entry.  Like
 *		  state notifier, we can only see "state" when the screen is on, so
 *		  it is pointless to expose to userspace. Topped off with some cleanup.
 *
 * v2.0   Final cleanup to functionality.  For faster response to screen on/off events,
 *		  ensure that the previous work is cancelled upon a valid requested state change.
 *		  Switched back to a single thread workqueue but allocated properly. Topped off
 *		  with some driver cleanup and a config option for using the SUB_MINOR_VERISON.
 *
 * v2.1   Provide a user-configurable option to sync the system on powersuspend.
 *
 * v2.2   Remove the mutex unlock mistakingly added during system sync setup.
 *
 * v2.3   Move cancelling previous state's work to the current state change work item.
 *
 * v2.4   Back out of suspend if the device is in the process of rebooting, powering
 *		  off, or poweroff_charging. Additionally, refactor abort handling so that
 *		  sys_sync isnt called within a mutex-locked region.  Additionally, set sysfs
 *		  up in a way that doesn't allow for failure. No functional change
 *		  to actual suspend/resume handling other than the fixes mentioned.
 *
 * v2.5	  Added a big, scary hook to call pm_suspend.
