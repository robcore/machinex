+Qualcomm RPM Regulators
+
+rpm-regulator-smd is a regulator driver which supports regulators inside of
+PMICs which are controlled by the RPM processor.  Communication with the RPM
+processor takes place over SMD.
+
+Required structure:
+- RPM regulators must be described in two levels of devices nodes.  The first
+	level describes the interface with the RPM.  The second level describes
+	properties of one regulator framework interface (of potentially many) to
+	the regulator.
+
+[First Level Nodes]
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible:          Must be "qcom,rpm-regulator-smd-resource"
+- qcom,resource-name:  Resource name string for this regulator to be used in RPM
+			transactions.  Length is 4 characters max.
+- qcom,resource-id:    Resource instance ID for this regulator to be used in RPM
+			transactions.
+- qcom,regulator-type: Type of this regulator.  Supported values are:
+				0 = LDO
+				1 = SMPS
+				2 = VS
+				3 = NCP
+
+Optional properties:
+- qcom,allow-atomic:   Flag specifying if atomic access is allowed for this
+			regulator.  Supported values are:
+				0 or not present = mutex locks used
+				1 = spinlocks used
+- qcom,enable-time:    Time in us to delay after enabling the regulator
+- qcom,hpm-min-load:   Load current in uA which corresponds to the minimum load
+			which requires the regulator to be in high power mode.
+
+[Second Level Nodes]
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible:          Must be "qcom,rpm-regulator-smd"
+- regulator-name:      A string used as a descriptive name for regulator outputs
+- qcom,set:            Specifies which sets that requests made with this
+			regulator interface should be sent to.  Regulator
+			requests sent in the active set take effect immediately.
+			Requests sent in the sleep set take effect when the Apps
+			processor transitions into RPM assisted power collapse.
+			Supported values are:
+				1 = Active set only
+				2 = Sleep set only
+				3 = Both active and sleep sets
+
+
+
+Optional properties:
+- parent-supply:               phandle to the parent supply/regulator node
+- qcom,system-load:            Load in uA present on regulator that is not
+				captured by any consumer request
+The following properties specify initial values for parameters to be sent to the
+RPM in regulator requests.
+- qcom,init-enable:            0 = regulator disabled
+			       1 = regulator enabled
+- qcom,init-voltage:           Voltage in uV
+- qcom,init-current:           Current in mA
+- qcom,init-ldo-mode:          Operating mode to be used with LDO regulators
+				Supported values are:
+					0 = mode determined by current requests
+					1 = force HPM (NPM)
+- qcom,init-smps-mode:         Operating mode to be used with SMPS regulators
+				Supported values are:
+					0 = auto; hardware determines mode
+					1 = mode determined by current requests
+					2 = force HPM (PWM)
+- qcom,init-pin-ctrl-enable:   Bit mask specifying which hardware pins should be
+				used to enable the regulator, if any; supported
+				bits are:
+					0 = ignore all hardware enable signals
+					BIT(0) = follow HW0_EN signal
+					BIT(1) = follow HW1_EN signal
+					BIT(2) = follow HW2_EN signal
+					BIT(3) = follow HW3_EN signal
+- qcom,init-pin-ctrl-mode:     Bit mask specifying which hardware pins should be
+				used to force the regulator into high power
+				mode, if any.  Supported bits are:
+					0 = ignore all hardware enable signals
+					BIT(0) = follow HW0_EN signal
+					BIT(1) = follow HW1_EN signal
+					BIT(2) = follow HW2_EN signal
+					BIT(3) = follow HW3_EN signal
+					BIT(4) = follow PMIC awake state
+- qcom,init-frequency:         Switching frequency in MHz for SMPS regulators.
+				Supported values are:
+					 0 = Don't care about frequency used
+					 1 = 19.20
+					 2 = 9.60
+					 3 = 6.40
+					 4 = 4.80
+					 5 = 3.84
+					 6 = 3.20
+					 7 = 2.74
+					 8 = 2.40
+					 9 = 2.13
+					10 = 1.92
+					11 = 1.75
+					12 = 1.60
+					13 = 1.48
+					14 = 1.37
+					15 = 1.28
+					16 = 1.20
+- qcom,init-head-room:         Voltage head room in uV required for the
+				regulator
+- qcom,init-quiet-mode:        Specify that quiet mode is needed for an SMPS
+				regulator in order to have lower output noise.
+				Supported values are:
+					0 = No quiet mode
+					1 = Quiet mode
+					2 = Super quiet mode
+- qcom,init-freq-reason:       Consumer requiring specified frequency for an
+				SMPS regulator.  Supported values are:
+					0 = None
+					1 = Bluetooth
+					2 = GPS
+					4 = WLAN
+					8 = WAN
+
+All properties specified within the core regulator framework can also be used in
+second level nodes.  These bindings can be found in:
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
