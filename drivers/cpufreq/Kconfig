config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	default y
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

         that frequency transitions use the CPUFreq table directly,
         instead of incrementing in a percentage of the maximum
         available frequency. Second 'abyssplug' will offline auxillary
         CPUs when the system is idle, and online those CPUs once the
         system becomes busy again. This last feature is needed for
         architectures which transition to low power states when only
         the "master" CPU is online, or for thermally constrained
         devices.
         If you don't have one of these architectures or devices, use

	  to an intermediate frequency when high load is encountered at low
	  frequencies. If very high load is encountered above this intermediate
	  frequency, it jumps to a high frequency. For moderate loads, it
	  votes to increase, decrease, or maintain frequencies at each sampling
	  interval. When enough votes are gathered to raise or lower the
	  frequency, the frequency is changed. This mechanism reduces jitter
	  compared to the conservative governor. Lionfish uses proportional
	  ramping to more quickly reach suitable frequencies compared to the
	  conservative governor. By default, Lionfish also reduces frequencies
